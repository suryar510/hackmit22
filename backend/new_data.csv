For our challenge, we’ll run a mini-version of that selection process, giving you a taste of what it’s really like to try and raise venture capital for your team + idea! App submission due 3pm, Saturday, and we’ll host interviews from 7pm late into the night.

Process:
Idea: Choose an idea–you can use whatever you’re building at the hackathon as the basis for the idea you will apply with, but you should choose whatever startup idea you feel most excited about.
Application: Each team must submit this application by 3pm, Saturday
Biography: Each team member must separately submit a biography for themselves. Make sure the team name matches what’s on your application.
Interview: A subset of applicants will be invited to interview with us. You will receive an email around 5pm on Saturday with a link to sign up for an interview slot. We will run interviews from 7pm into Saturday night. Interviews will take 3-5 minutes, and will be similar to the interview style we use for Y Combinator. Interviews will be done in person in a private room near our booth.

Prizes:
Winners receive all of below:
Office hours / mentorship session with a YC Partner
Real interview for Y Combinator (no expiration, come interview whenever you want)
Dinner on Sunday, with YC team (if in person)




Criteria:
We will evaluate 2 main aspects: The team (solo is ok) and the idea. When writing your application, try to highlight any aspects of your team and idea that match what we look for. Keep in mind the below are rough guidelines–there are many different kinds of ‘good’ teams and ideas!
Good teams tend to:
Be close with each other and work well together
Have built things before, even small things. Bonus if people used what you built!
Have outlier qualities, even if those qualities seem unrelated to building a startup (for ex: picking up snowboarding at age 15 and winning a local competition 3 years later)
Have a level of sophistication about how the world works
Good ideas tend to:
Solve a real pain point and provide lots of value.  It’s better to build something one person really needs than something 100 people only kinda want.
Have unique insight driving the idea. That unique insight often comes from a unique experience or perspective.  For example, the DoorDash founders moved from New York City to Stanford. When they were unpacking, they called 5 Chinese and Thai restaurants trying to order delivery like they would in NYC, but none would do it!
Be hard to pull off.  If there were a good idea that was easy to build and execute, somebody would’ve done it already. For example, plenty of people could have built a simple version of the Airbnb website in a week, but it’s hard to convince a host to let a stranger stay in their home.
Have tech as a key piece of the idea.  A test I like to use: Can you imagine 5 engineers working on this problem space? 50? 500? What will they work on?
Be big! To get funding, you’ll usually need to make a case that there’s a chance your company could turn into something huge. A good way to frame this is to benchmark against other successful companies:  Assuming your idea succeeds, could it be as big as Scale AI? How about Stripe? How about Google?

What to expect in the interview:

The interview is free-form, meaning we don’t use a set question list.  If we’re doing our job right, the interview should feel like a real conversation where you’re trying to explain to somebody what the idea is and why it makes sense.  To that end, the best preparation is actually talking to your friends about the idea.  Explain what it is and answer whatever questions they have for 5 minutes. After explaining what the idea is, the idea criteria above make a good starting point for how to think about whether your idea is promising.

Interview tips:
Be honest and natural. Explain things how you would explain them to a close friend.
Don’t use jargon, fancy terms, or complicated, flowery sentence structure. 
Be straight and to the point. Feel free to give detail, but if you’re answering a question for 2 minutes straight, that’s no good. We only have 3-5 minutes for the whole interview!
Share talking time. It’s fine to choose 1-2 primary answers, but more than 1 person should answer questions in the interview.
