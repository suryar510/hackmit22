https://hackmit.org/_0	HackMIT is a weekend-long event where thousands of students from around the world come together to work on cool software and/or hardware projects. As one of the largest undergraduate hackathons in the world, we typically bring in over 1000 students to MIT's campus each fall. This year, HackMIT is back to being fully in-person on MIT's campus during the weekend of October 1st. Students will be building, learning, and creating technology projects from scratch. Websites and mobile apps are common types of hacks, but you can build anything! Think outside the box : ) The Education track aims to empower students and teachers by exploring the ways that Education Technology (EdTech) can augment learning. As schools navigate the return to in-person teaching, it is especially important that we adapt remote teaching tools and support students in making up for lost time in their education. Projects in this track will encourage a love of learning, recognize a variety of learning styles, and aim to make education more accessible.
https://hackmit.org/_1	Projects in the New Frontiers track will incorporate tech emerging at the very forefront of industry, including but not limited to blockchain and Web3, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and VR/AR. We challenge hackers in this track to think deeply about how the new technology they implement will add meaningful value to their project and push the frontiers of possibility.
https://hackmit.org/_2	The Entertainment track promotes the use of technology as a means of expression, encouraging hackers to explore the ways that we create, consume, and share content. Projects in this track will make the most of hackers’ interdisciplinary skills, perhaps by incorporating music, graphics, and other creative mediums, as well as keeping the user at the forefront of design.
https://hackmit.org/_3	The Sustainability track encourages hackers to use technology to pursue a more sustainable future on environmental, economic, and social levels. As sustainability encompasses all aspects of human life, projects in this track will address a diverse range of topics like food, finance, energy, transportation, water, awareness & accountability, and fashion.

Companies were beginning to realize that the mountains of data that they'd previously been discarding were in fact their most valuable resource. I ended up on my Data Engineering journey mainly by luck, as I wasn't introduced to any of the concepts in school, but it's a great field and I hope to convince a few of you to consider it. I'd like to introduce you to the idea of Data Engineering as a career and the many possibilities and unique opportunities that come along with it. Maybe you're like me and have never had any interest in web dev. Maybe you find analytics and data science fascinating but you're not sure how they relate to the Computer Science fundamentals you're already learning. Maybe you'd prefer a lower-stress job where you're rarely on call and can always fix your script in the morning. Whatever the case, let's hang out and explore if this in-demand tech role might be right for you.

https://dayof.hackmit.org/_34	The problem with digital ownership: In the current digital ownership paradigm, user’s personal data is owned and controlled by third parties. Tech giants have access to vast troves of data, putting the power in their hands rather than the users who own this data. While this has proven lucrative for technology companies, users are faced with a number of problems: we’ve heard time and time again of user-data being sold without permission or stolen by hackers. These problems are furthered by the user’s inability to dictate who has access to their data.

Teams can choose to build entirely on the client side - where they interact with existing programs (smart contracts) on Solana's blockchain, or they can build one or more on-chain programs to create their own smart contract functionality. Of course, you can also do both! We love to see working code and deployed programs, but equally important are the idea itself, how it utilizes Solana, what it can do for the community, and the quality of the presentation overall. Tech Requirements: To build client-side dApps on Solana you'll need at least Node JS. To build on-chain programs (smart contracts) you'll need to either use the online IDE (https://beta.solpg.io) or install Rust (with Cargo, Clippy, etc. ), Solana CLI, and optionally Anchor.

Sustainability practices and solutions need to benefit all communities, but especially those communities that have been marginalized and polluted in the past. Technology is key, as it can provide effective, scalable solutions to address sustainability challenges. HackMIT participants are eligible to submit their completed projects to the Call for Code Global Challenge. Judging Criteria: Submissions will be judged across 4 key criteria: Completeness and transferability How fully has the idea been implemented? Can it achieve an impact in the field? Can it be transferred elsewhere? Effectiveness and efficiency Does the solution address a high-priority area? Does it achieve its goal effectively and efficiently? Can it scale? Design and usability How good is the design, user experience, and ease of use of the solution? How quickly can it be put to use? Creativity and innovation How unique was the approach to solving a long-standing or previously intractable problem? The metaverse will be built by everyone, with creative ideas and practical applications being developed every day by all sorts of imaginative people.

Quantitative investing relies on extracting information from many forms, including natural language. Your challenge is to apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to any source of textual information. Can you find interesting ways to represent or extract information from the text, so that it facilitates systematic analysis and comparison? Projects will be judged on their success at extracting information, selecting and producing interesting metrics, and clearly communicating results for a set of comparable examples. The consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry is a fast-growing, multi-trillion dollar industry that still relies on outdated technology such as pencil-and-paper and spreadsheets. We're looking for creative and interesting projects that relate to this industry and the challenges CPG brands and retailers face! We’re in search of bold new thinking. This is a call to the NEXT GENERATION. An invitation to solve the problem of medical error that harms millions of U.S. patients and costs billions of dollars every year. We’re calling on HackMIT teams to envision the best technology-enabled patient safety solution that has the potential to avert patient harm and save lives. We will be giving a total of $2,750 in cash prizes: $1,500 for 1st prize, $750 for 2nd prize, and $500 for the 3rd prize. Rules: Your hack must align with one of the following five leading patient safety challenges facing health care across the continuum of care. Medication errors (e.g. medication administration, acute kidney injury, hypoglycemia, delirium) Procedural/surgical errors (e.g. pneumothorax, excessive bleeding, intestinal perforation) Errors during routine patient care (e.g. pressure ulcers, blood clots, falls) Infections (e.g. respiratory infections, surgical site infections, central line-associated blood stream infections) Diagnostic safety (e.g. missed, delayed or wrong diagnoses) We encourage teams to consider autonomous patient safety solutions, those where the automation of an existing technology can improve patient safety by easing the burden on our healthcare workforce that is burning out and turning over at astonishing rates that are not sustainable. WHY PATIENT SAFETY? Even before the pandemic, medical errors were estimated to be the third leading cause of death in the U.S., contributing to 250,000 deaths per year and even more permanent disabilities. While traditional approaches to patient safety have resulted in short-term improvements, these “spot removals” have not yet moved the needle on reducing medical errors in the U.S. The pandemic created another “pandemic” of medical mishaps. During COVID-19, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention observed further “substantial deterioration” in patient safety metrics. As healthcare systems diverted their attention and resources to pandemic preparedness and response, overwhelmed, exhausted, and eventually diminished frontline teams struggled to observe traditional patient safety processes. These existing practices can be supplemented by modern tools and autonomous technologies to create environments that are wired to optimize safety. Patient safety technology solutions have never been more feasible and necessary but often are off-the-radar of innovators, and the new Patient Safety Technology Challenge is seeking to galvanize fresh approaches for integrating novel approaches. We bring this issue to you to lean on your fresh perspective and tech acumen. Now is the moment to focus intently on driving patient safety improvement by deploying the same technologies and advanced analytics that have made other industries progressively safer. YOU are the future leaders in tech, business, and healthcare and you can be part of the solution! JUDGING CRITERIA: Over the 24 hours of the hackathon we expect teams will: Present a well-formed technology-enabled solution addresses on one of the 5 leading categories of harm. Pick a specific problem under one of the 5 categories and make a compelling case about how their innovative hack will address that specific problem. Describe how their innovative technology-enabled solution will be impactful in diverting harm and/or saving the lives of patients. Demonstrate a good understanding of the risks and costs of the technological solution proposed. The 24-hour timeline of the hackathon will be considered when assessing the viability of the innovative technology-enabled solution. At Five Rings, distributed systems are at the heart of all the work we do. We will be looking for the best project making use of a distributed architecture. Here are a few examples, but don't feel limited in your approach! Coordination of multiple processes IPC, such as shared memory or RPCs Pub/sub message model Parallel computation Judging Criteria: We will be judging on the following criteria: How suited the chosen architecture is for the problem being solved Technical complexity Project creativity At Panera, we embrace the opportunity to spread generosity to our communities, the planet, and you. We will be looking for the project that best focuses on using technology to spread generosity.
