https://hackmit.org/	HackMIT 2022 HackMIT 2022 10.01 - 10.02 HackMIT is a weekend-long event where thousands of students from around the world come together to work on cool software and/or hardware projects. As one of the largest undergraduate hackathons in the world  we typically bring in over 1000 students to MIT's campus each fall. This year  HackMIT is back to being fully in-person on MIT's campus during the weekend of October 1st. Students will be building  learning  and creating technology projects from scratch. Websites and mobile apps are common types of hacks  but you can build anything! Think outside the box : ) NEW FRONTIERS ENTERTAINMENT SUSTAINABILITY DESCRIPTION GUIDING QUESTIONS The Education track aims to empower students and teachers by exploring the ways that Education Technology (EdTech) can augment learning. As schools navigate the return to in-person teaching  it is especially important that we adapt remote teaching tools and support students in making up for lost time in their education. Projects in this track will encourage a love of learning  recognize a variety of learning styles  and aim to make education more accessible. What tools from remote learning can be adapted and brought into the in-person classroom? How can we use technology to facilitate collaboration in school? How can we use tech to support students of all backgrounds and enable universal access to quality education? How can we ensure that classroom technology promotes learning without disrupting it? How can we make technology that makes students feel safe in schools? Canvas LMS API Manim by 3Blue1Brown Google Classroom API Blackboard API NEW FRONTIERS DESCRIPTION GUIDING QUESTIONS Projects in the New Frontiers track will incorporate tech emerging at the very forefront of industry  including but not limited to blockchain and Web3  artificial intelligence  machine learning  and VR/AR. We challenge hackers in this track to think deeply about how the new technology they implement will add meaningful value to their project and push the frontiers of possibility. Web3 is about reimagining the internet in the hands of the users—how can we develop new decentralized technologies that empower ordinary people? How can we make machine learning more accessible to non-programmers? How can we make applications that utilize machine learning less opaque? How can we use AR and VR on M E T A V E R S E ?? stonks Tensorflow  Pytorch The Sonr Highway SDK ENTERTAINMENT DESCRIPTION GUIDING QUESTIONS The Entertainment track promotes the use of technology as a means of expression  encouraging hackers to explore the ways that we create  consume  and share content. Projects in this track will make the most of hackers’ interdisciplinary skills  perhaps by incorporating music  graphics  and other creative mediums  as well as keeping the user at the forefront of design. How can entertainment be used to share a message? How can we collaborate with non-technical hackers to add something meaningful to technical projects? How can we create entertaining technology that doesn't compromise the mental and physical health of users? How can we focus and expand on UI and UX to enhance a user's takeaway from technology? How can we develop new ways to visualize data? How can we incorporate physical components or outside interaction into software? Spotify API Twitter API SUSTAINABILITY DESCRIPTION GUIDING QUESTIONS The Sustainability track encourages hackers to use technology to pursue a more sustainable future on environmental  economic  and social levels. As sustainability encompasses all aspects of human life  projects in this track will address a diverse range of topics like food  finance  energy  transportation  water  awareness & accountability  and fashion. How can we use technology to incentivize sustainable habits? How can we use tech to spread awareness about sustainability? How can we use tech to monitor our own habits/behaviors? Datavis to help people understand the gravity of situations? How can we encourage behaviors with concrete impact  not “greenwashing”? How can we address the tradeoff between sustainability and affordability? In what ways is our current technology unsustainable  and how could we address this?

Companies were beginning to realize that the mountains of data that they'd previously been discarding were in fact their most valuable resource. I ended up on my Data Engineering journey mainly by luck  as I wasn't introduced to any of the concepts in school  but it's a great field and I hope to convince a few of you to consider it. I'd like to introduce you to the idea of Data Engineering as a career and the many possibilities and unique opportunities that come along with it. Maybe you're like me and have never had any interest in web dev. Maybe you find analytics and data science fascinating but you're not sure how they relate to the Computer Science fundamentals you're already learning. Maybe you'd prefer a lower-stress job where you're rarely on call and can always fix your script in the morning. Whatever the case  let's hang out and explore if this in-demand tech role might be right for you.

The problem with digital ownership: In the current digital ownership paradigm  user’s personal data is owned and controlled by third parties. Tech giants have access to vast troves of data  putting the power in their hands rather than the users who own this data. While this has proven lucrative for technology companies  users are faced with a number of problems: we’ve heard time and time again of user-data being sold without permission or stolen by hackers. These problems are furthered by the user’s inability to dictate who has access to their data. What we are building: Sonr is building the user-owned internet where you have full control over your data and digital identity. Our ecosystem gives developers the tools to build user-centric decentralized web applications. During this hackathon we will give you the opportunity to try out our software development tools  and potentially win prizes!

Care packages consisting of products from Vividly's customers :) Pittsburgh Regional Health Initiative BIG IDEA: Best Technology-Enabled Patient Safety Solutions We’re in search of bold new thinking. This is a call to the NEXT GENERATION. An invitation to solve the problem of medical error that harms millions of U.S. patients and costs billions of dollars every year. We’re calling on HackMIT teams to envision the best technology-enabled patient safety solution that has the potential to avert patient harm and save lives. We will be giving a total of $2 750 in cash prizes: $1 500 for 1st prize  $750 for 2nd prize  and $500 for the 3rd prize. Your hack must align with one of the following five leading patient safety challenges facing health care across the continuum of care. Medication errors (e.g. medication administration  acute kidney injury  hypoglycemia  delirium) Procedural/surgical errors (e.g. pneumothorax  excessive bleeding  intestinal perforation) Errors during routine patient care (e.g. pressure ulcers  blood clots  falls) Infections (e.g. respiratory infections  surgical site infections  central line-associated blood stream infections) Diagnostic safety (e.g. missed  delayed or wrong diagnoses) We encourage teams to consider autonomous patient safety solutions  those where the automation of an existing technology can improve patient safety by easing the burden on our healthcare workforce that is burning out and turning over at astonishing rates that are not sustainable. WHY PATIENT SAFETY? Even before the pandemic  medical errors were estimated to be the third leading cause of death in the U.S.  contributing to 250 000 deaths per year and even more permanent disabilities. While traditional approaches to patient safety have resulted in short-term improvements  these “spot removals” have not yet moved the needle on reducing medical errors in the U.S. The pandemic created another “pandemic” of medical mishaps. During COVID-19  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention observed further “substantial deterioration” in patient safety metrics. As healthcare systems diverted their attention and resources to pandemic preparedness and response  overwhelmed  exhausted  and eventually diminished frontline teams struggled to observe traditional patient safety processes. These existing practices can be supplemented by modern tools and autonomous technologies to create environments that are wired to optimize safety. Patient safety technology solutions have never been more feasible and necessary but often are off-the-radar of innovators  and the new Patient Safety Technology Challenge is seeking to galvanize fresh approaches for integrating novel approaches. We bring this issue to you to lean on your fresh perspective and tech acumen. Now is the moment to focus intently on driving patient safety improvement by deploying the same technologies and advanced analytics that have made other industries progressively safer. YOU are the future leaders in tech  business  and healthcare and you can be part of the solution! JUDGING CRITERIA: Over the 24 hours of the hackathon we expect teams will: Present a well-formed technology-enabled solution addresses on one of the 5 leading categories of harm. Pick a specific problem under one of the 5 categories and make a compelling case about how their innovative hack will address that specific problem. Describe how their innovative technology-enabled solution will be impactful in diverting harm and/or saving the lives of patients. Demonstrate a good understanding of the risks and costs of the technological solution proposed. The 24-hour timeline of the hackathon will be considered when assessing the viability of the innovative technology-enabled solution.
